problems to solve:

Done. Syntax error handling got big problem
Done. after unset PATH, should be able to execute by absolute path like /bin/ls
Done. cd in brackets shouldn't execute
3. prompt use of forbidden functions
Done. exit in pipes shouldn't execute
Done. parser folder no need
Done. rename spliter folder and combine pipes and redir files into one folder
1. Multiple redirections
2. Heredoc
4. Pipe and redirection combined got problem
5. redir operators should be removed from the cmd_argv

big goals:

1. wildcards
2. redirections
3. norminette :)

unsolved test case:
cd | cd  (should not work)
export _= (should ignore)
command not found has leaks
echo hi | grep hi (leaks)
> test (not working)
echo < Makefile (should do nothing and print a newline)
cd ~/Desktop/42_minishell/ (~ need to expand in ms_cd.c)
