problems to solve:

1. after unset PATH, should be able to execute by absolute path like /bin/ls
2. cd in brackets shouldn't execute
3. prompt use of forbidden functions
4. exit in pipes shouldn't execute
5. parser folder no need
6. rename spliter folder and combine pipes and redir files into one folder

big goals:

1. wildcards
2. redirections
3. norminette :)
